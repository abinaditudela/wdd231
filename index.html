    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Ad√°n Tudela, I'm 26 years old, and I'm from Cochabamba, Bolivia. I love learning and thrive on mental and logic games, which challenge my problem-solving skills. Soccer is my favorite sport, and listening to music is my best hobby; both provide a great balance to my life.</p>
    <p>Programming is my passion, and I'm currently finishing my studies to become a software developer. As a systems engineer, I value attention to detail, collaboration, and continuous learning. I'm dedicated, proactive, and always looking for ways to improve. My goal is to create innovative and efficient solutions to real-world problems and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
